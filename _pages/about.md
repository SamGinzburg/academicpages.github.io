My name is Sam Ginzburg, and I am recent UMass CS alumni. I recently finished my senior thesis working on the [Browsix](https://www.browsix.org) project with [Prof. Berger](https://emeryberger.com/) and [Prof. Mark Corner](https://markdcorner.com/) in the [PLASMA Lab](https://plasma-umass.org/), where I worked on backing sockets with WebRTC sockets, so that Browsix instances could communicate with each other across tabs.

I also previously did bioinformatics research at UConn where I worked on the EnTAP project in the [Plant Computational Genomics Lab](https://compgenomics.lab.uconn.edu/) with Prof. Jill Wegrzyn on improving the accuracy and speed of functional annotations for de novo transcriptome (gene space) assemblies of non-model Eukaryotic species.

I have also done several internships in industry at large companies such as Microsoft and VMware. At Microsoft I worked on both the ReFS filesystem where I built a tool to check for storage leaks, and on the kernel mode memory allocator where I ported the NT Segment Heap to run in kernel mode, to back the memory pools with the NT Segment Heap. You can see the heap changes for yourself in the Windows 10 build 17672 fast ring build. [You can read this thread to see how to enable the heap backed pool on your system.](https://twitter.com/epakskape/status/997527812096475136) I am currently at VMware and will update what I am working on currently in the future.

I am interested in both the design and implementation of computer systems, as well as the security of those systems.
