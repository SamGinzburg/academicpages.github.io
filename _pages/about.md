My name is Sam Ginzburg and I am currently a graduate student interested in the design, implementation, and security of computer systems. I previously worked at both Microsoft and VMware as a software engineering intern on various operating systems projects. I also did research at UMass-Amherst in the PLASMA lab with [Prof. Berger](https://emeryberger.com/) as my primary advisor on the [Browsix](https://www.browsix.org) project, where I implemented the cross-tab networking features. Before that I did research at UConn in the [Plant Computational Genomics Lab](https://compgenomics.lab.uconn.edu/) with Prof. Jill Wegrzyn, working on the enTAP project.
