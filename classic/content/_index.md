# Sam Ginzburg

### Brief Bio

I am a second year PhD Student in the [SNS Group](https://sns.cs.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University working with Professor [Michael Freedman](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed/). I am broadly interested in systems and systems security research. As of right now I am currently investigating the performance and potential applications of functions as a service (FaaS) platforms in the cloud, such as Amazon Lambda. I am also currently working on side channel defences that can provide quantitative bounds on information leakage.

I previously did undergraduate research in the [PLASMA](https://plasma-umass.org/) research group at UMass - Amherst with [Prof. Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com/). Before that, I did undergraduate research at UConn working in the [UConn Plant Computational Genomic Lab](https://compgenomics.lab.uconn.edu/) with Prof. [Jill Wegrzyn](https://twitter.com/JillWegrzyn) on the enTAP project.
